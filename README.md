## Course Description

Data Science called as “the sexiest job of the 21st century” by [Harvard Business Review.](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century), and in this period ["the world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data"](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721656-data-economy-demands-new-approach-antitrust-rules-worlds-most-valuable-resource). This course helps students to understand the basic concepts of Data Science like information extraction from the vast amounts of data using different scientific methods. It explains how the data is manipulated and processed to unravel useful underlying information from the raw and unstructured data. The course follows an example-based approach in terms of providing a better understanding on how data science techniques are applied in the real-world problems. Furthermore, the course provides insights to the ethical use of data, which has become very crucial with the rampant and abundant generation of data.

Programming Language used: Python, Julia, R

## Course Objective

- To introduce the basic concepts and techniques of Data Science.
- To give an insight to data visualization
- To understand the current scenario and application of Data Science.
- To understand how Data Science techniques are used in real-world problems.

## Prerequisites

It is expected that students have prior knowledge of mathematical preliminaries such as Probabilities and Statistics, Calculus and Linear Algebra. Besides, students should have the knowledge of high-level programming languages like C and C++ or Python to understand the concepts of Data Science and implement projects.
